Current project named University managing implements fundamental functions (only backend) for managing a university. I aim with the project to learn hot to use ASP.NET WEB API.  
About the project:  
1. Has three roles-admin, professor, student
2. Every role can access only permitted API endpoints
3. All authorization and validity checks are implemented
4. Admin is faculty - separated
